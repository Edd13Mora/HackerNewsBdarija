A project I decided to start to share with the Moroccan community my journey as a Hacker! 
Its the story of Eddie Mora and his two friends Pwny and Jakom where they will share funny stories about Hacking in realy life!
The broject will include cyber security news, bugs explainations and our funny moments during CTF games!
The idea is to make the community more bigger by using a simple language with funny characters...
Its a digital item so people can use it from anywehere, any time.
We still developing the idea and we think to make it more interesting,
If you have any idea or any way to colaborate with us, ur welcome anytime ðŸ›¡
